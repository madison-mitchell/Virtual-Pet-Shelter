Assignment Instructions: https://wecancodeit.github.io/java-exercises/virtual-pet-shelter/

The shelter comes setup with five different pets ready to be taken care of. When you start the program
you'll be greeted with a table showing your pets and the status of their different needs asking you where
you want to start with taking care of them. Enter the number correlating to the task you with to perform.

Don't forget in this pet shelter that you can adopt a pet, or admit one. Be careful though! If you don't 
take care of your pets most basic needs they can become unwell. And if you let it get too bad, **your 
pets can die!** Should all your pets perish, the shelter will close, and you might even get an unpleasant 
surprise. Take care of your pets!
